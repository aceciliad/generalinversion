# InversionNonAdiabatic
# generalinversion

General inversion set up, divided in different classes that:
1. Read input parameters
2. Model interior structure of Mars
3. Runs forward for seismic data, i.e., receiver functions, travel times, normal modes, etc.
4. Compute misfits and invert for interior structure and event locations

Runs the prediction of travel times in parallel to account for the "two" models employed to produced phases when we consider a liquid layer at the bottom of the mantle. 

Many things could be enhanced :)
